# üõ†Ô∏è Software Engineering Sessional

This repository contains my sessional submissions for the Software Engineering course. The goal was to apply key software design principles using Java, focusing on object-oriented programming, design patterns, and unit testing.

## üìö Topics Covered

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Solved a set of foundational problems using core OOP principles such as:
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction

### 2. Creational Design Patterns
Implemented examples of commonly used creational patterns including:
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Builder
  
These patterns helped understand object creation mechanisms and improve code flexibility.

### 3. Structural Design Patterns
Practiced patterns that simplify relationships between classes, such as:
- Adapter
- Decorator

### 4. Unit Testing
Used **JUnit** to write and run unit tests for the developed classes and methods. Focused on test-driven development (TDD) principles and improving code reliability.
